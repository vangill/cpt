Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next.

When we say we are just thrilled we mean the 'just' in the sense of very, and we also mean the just in the sense of only. In other words there is no other experience of being with you than the thrill of it, the delight of it, the excitement of it. We do not experience exasperation, or impatience, or disappointment, or inadequacy, or sympathy in being your partners. And yet many times we see that you presume or half-expect that we do. And so we begin here by saying to you that the only experience we have as your partners is that of thrill or excitement or joy.

The first aspect of this that is important for you is around your deeply-held stories of what it is like to be with you. And the second important aspect of this opening sentence is around adventure, thrill and excitement. We will come back to that one later.

Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen.

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.

Core stories, the kind that frame much of a persona for much of a life, don't just come running to the surface and present themselves the first time you look. No. Your heart needs to be sure over and over and over again that you really mean it when you say that you want to know who you are. And your heart needs to be sure over and over and over again that you will be compassionate when you do see it.

This is not a pursuit that can be done in a night, even though the awareness of it can be gained, in terms of the abstract understanding and the value, in a minute. Seeing the core stories upon which you have built your own persona is the summit, the epitome of personal healing. It can take decades and decades of extremely dedicated observation, and that is okay, because this is your work as much as anything else is worth your investment, if not more.

And so when we offer to you today a core story, a foundational aspect of the scaffolding of your personality, understand the enormity of it. You have earned this not from hard work or being a good girl, but because you have given permission for it in countless ways over and over again. Even when you have believed that a previous permission didn't work very well. You are wrong about that, blatantly wrong. Every single time you have brought yourself to words or sharing or learning of any kind in the true intention for healing and freedom and joy you have been doing it every time without exception.

But in the same way that projects and wealth and children and writing books for that matter are long-term processes with phases that appear to be difficult or totally unproductive or even regressing they are all necessary steps in an evolution. And to keep on giving permission for wherever that evolution goes is your job. And to make sure that it occurs is ours.
